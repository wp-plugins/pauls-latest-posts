= I'm using an old version of WordPress, will this plugin work? =
This plugin uses the Widget API built into WordPress since version 2.3.
Therefore, this plugin will not work on versions older than 2.3.
If you are using a version of WordPress prior to 2.3, then I suggest that you upgrade to the latest version.

If you want to, then yes. This plugin is released under the GPL. You are free to modify it, change it, re-distribute it as you want.
